# Jekyll Bootstrap Blank

All I wanted was a plain [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) template with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).  No extra themeing
system or crap.  It should be so simple, yet it wasn't there.  So I made it.

## Notes

Most of the settings you need to customize are in `_config.yml` and should be 
self explanatory.

I set the default layout to `default`, so if you have a non-HTML page that has front matter, you need to specify
the `none` layout.

All pages go into the `sitemap.xml` file unless they have `noindex: true` in the front matter.

You should change the `favicon.ico` file.  The [default one](http://findicons.com/icon/441593/under_construction) is 
by [Ömer ÇETİN](http://omercetin.net/) via [FindIcons](http://findicons.com/icon/441593/under_construction).
